# Reinforcement Doodles
This repo contains some toy implementations of deep reinforcement learning using Q-learning and actor-critic approach for two environments:
 
 - Frozen lake 8X8
 - Tic tac toe
 
Both were made just for laughs and both contain awful code technniques and are not really well optimized.
I'll be updating these to perform better and do more stuff.
